# Pricing Calculator Frontend POC

Hi Everyone, this is the front-end of the idea we represented at the Locad's Hackathon 1.0 with some strong backend API's.
 
  This is not so cool, becuase it was developed within less than 48 hours. Also this 48 hours included fun with the team, eating out in bangalore,etc

  We came 2nd(Runner up) in Locad's Hackathon 1.0.
